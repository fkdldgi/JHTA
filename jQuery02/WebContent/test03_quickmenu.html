			jQuery API jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript
			library. <br> It makes things like HTML document traversal and
			manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with
			an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. <br>
			If you're new to jQuery, we recommend that you check out the jQuery
			Learning Center. <br> If you're updating to a newer version of
			jQuery, be sure to read the release notes published on our blog. <br>
			If you're coming from a version prior 1.9, you should check out the
			1.9 Upgrade Guide as well.<br> Note that this is the API
			documentation for jQuery core. Other projects have API docs in other
			locations:<br> <br>
